# Computer Vision

This repo contains my projects in Computer Vision

## Projecst

1. Facial Expression Classifier

Combining object detection and image classification to build a real-time expression
classifier 

2. Image Denoising

Denoise MNIST images using an encoder-decoder model

3. Image Segmentation (Not complete)

Implementing FCn8 and Unet architecture to create encoder-decoder models to segment
images using cityscape images 

4. Resnet (Not complete)

Implementing Resnet architecture from scratch

5. Super resolution

Implementing Unet encoder-decoder to enchance hand images quality

6. TFDS
  1. TF-Hub models
  
  Using models from TF-Hub to solve computer vision problems (classification, etc.)
